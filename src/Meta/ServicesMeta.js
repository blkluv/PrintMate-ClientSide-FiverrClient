                    "An A-frame board is essentially a double-sided poster frame than stands outside a shop or business to drive traffic inside. That means the only thing youâ€™ll need to design is the poster!",
                    "First things first, youâ€™ll need to choose one of the sizes we offer; either A2 poster frames or A0 if you want a really large poster frame!",
                    "Then, make your poster design to the size youâ€™ve chosen. Make sure you add 3mm bleed area to each side to account for the bleed area and remember than a very slight area (around 10mm on each side) around the edges of the poster wonâ€™t be visible when itâ€™s attached to the frame â€“ just keep your main message central!",
                    "The same poster is used on both sides of the A-frame sign so you only need one design. If you want to switch up or change your posters, you donâ€™t need to order another A-frame â€“ just order a new set of 220mic PVC posters to replace them.",

                    "An A-frame sign really makes a statement, but they work especially well in places where lots of people pass by â€“ like busy roadsides and shopping streets. We print your graphics on a weatherproof stock and the stand itself is made from brushed aluminium, meaning theyâ€™re ideal for outdoor use to tempt customers in. Theyâ€™re especially popular amongst restaurants and cafes, because itâ€™s an eye-catching way to promote offers and specials.",
